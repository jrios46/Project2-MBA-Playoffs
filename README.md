# Project2-NBA-Playoffs

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether an NBA team will make it to the playoffs based on various advanced statistics. The dataset used contains NBA team performance data from 1992 to 2024. The prediction models implemented include Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting playoff outcomes. 

## Main Notebook
The 'Main' notebook is dedicated to post-processing the data gathered from "NBA team Performance." This notebook effectively combines multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame, facilitating further analysis and processing of the consolidated data. 

## Statistics Notebook
The 'Statistics' notebook is the main project notebook, divided into several parts: 
  
#### Part 1 Exploring the data: 
In this part, we explore the dataset containing NBA team performance data. We analyze the structure of the data, identify missing values, and handle any inconsistencies. Exploratory data analysis techniques are used to gain insights into the variables and their relationships. 
      
#### Part 2 Analysis: 
The analysis phase involves a deeper examination of the data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations. We conduct statistical analysis and visualization to understand the factors that influence a team's performance and playoff eligibility. Key metrics and indicators are identified for further investigation.
  
#### Part 3 Creating the Models: 
Two machine learning models, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier, are created to predict playoff eligibility based on the identified features. The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics. A comparison is made between the two models to determine their effectiveness in predicting playoff outcomes.

#### Part 4 Data Preparation and Model Evaluation: 
In this part, the data is prepared for modeling by preprocessing, feature selection, and splitting into training and testing sets. The trained models are then evaluated on the testing set to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics. Model performance is visualized using confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Conclusion
By implementing Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models and optimizing them based on performance metrics, this project aims to predict NBA team playoff outcomes with high accuracy. The README file provides an overview of the project requirements, methodology, and expected outcomes. Further details, code implementation, and results can be found in the project repository.
